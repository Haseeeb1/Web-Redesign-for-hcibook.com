      "Standard software engineering formalisms can be used to specify an interactive system. These are of various types: <br /> - Model-based, such as Z, which describe the system's state and operations <br /> - Algebraic formalisms, which describe the effects of sequences of actions <br /> - Temporal and deontic logics, which describe when things happen and who is responsible.",
      "Special interaction models are designed specifically to describe usability properties, including: <br /> - Predictability and observability - what you can tell about the system from looking at it <br /> - Reachability and undo - what you can do with it.",
      "Most formal models and notations focus on events and changes that happen when they occur, but we need richer models to deal with: <br /> - Interstitial behavior - the things that happen between events such as dragging an icon <br /> - Physical objects in ubiquitous computing or virtual reality <br /> - The tension between precise time and more fuzzy human ideas of time."

    answer:
      "There is no single answer for this exercise, so we will provide an example of the style of answer that is suitable and the level of analysis that is appropriate.<br /><br />You should be aware that, although the term distance is used, we have not associated any real measures to any of the translations in the interaction framework.<br/><br/>As a result, this analysis can only be informal and at this point is mainly informed by one's intuition and experience with various interface styles.<br/><br/>As was stated in Section 3.2.3, assessment of any interaction with the interaction framework can only be relative to some task. For this example we will choose a common database selection task - selecting records from an online library database. The two interface styles we will analyze are a natural language interface and a command line interface.<br /><br />A natural language interface style would allow the user simply to type in the selection query exactly as they think of it. The articulation distance is small both because it is easy to articulate (possibly even easier if a spoken interface is provided rather than typing), and because the coverage is total (the user is allowed to articulate anything as a query). On the other hand, for a command line interface, the limited vocabulary of the input language makes it more difficult for the user to articulate a task even though the limited language provides complete coverage in terms of possible queries allowed.<br/><br/>The real difficulty for a natural language interface is how the system translates the input expression into the actual query that accesses the library records. This performance translation will be much easier for the command line interface since it may not even require any translation of an input expression, that language having already been constructed with the database engine in mind.Therefore, we can see that for a natural language interface the performance distance is greatest, whereas for a command line interface it is the articulation distance that is greatest.",

    answer:
      "(a) The answer depends on the answer to Question 3.4. The problem with putting all functions on the screen at once is that they will occupy too much screen space, leaving little room for anything else. Too many menu headings will make it difficult for the user to decide under which heading a desired command resides. Too few menu headings means that each menu will consist of many menu items, complicating the visual search task to locate the menu item and increasing the average length of time it takes to drag the mouse and select an options. Fitts' Law gives us a way to understand the impact of length of menu items and selection times.<br/><br/>We would tend to go for a larger number of smaller menus, under the assumption that it is possible to create clear conceptual boundaries between menu categories. If the eight categories lead to an easy to understand decomposition of the commands, then it would be easier to decide which menu to select and then would be quick to select a menu item among a small number of options. A small number of menus might result in an unclear decision on where to place some menu items.<br/><br/>(b) Open-ended experiment",

    question:
      "What was the problem with the synthesis example comparing a command language interface with a visual interface? Can you suggest a fix to make a visual interface really immediately honest?",
    answer: `
        To demonstrate the principle of synthesizability within learnability, it was stated in this example that a visual interface to a file management system provided immediate information about the changed location of some file after a move operation performed by the user. In contrast, a command language interface requires the user to remember the directory to which a file is moved and explicitly issue commands to browse the directory to verify that the file has been moved. To be really sure that a move occurred, the user would also have to browse the original directory to determine that the file was no longer there. The fallacy in this argument is the assumption that visual file management systems always provide information about the new whereabouts of a moved file. To take a counterexample using the Macintosh instance from the text, if a file is moved from an open folder (in which the contents of the folder are revealed to the user) to a closed folder (contents not revealed), then the location of the moved file is not indicated to the user unless she remembers to open up the destination folder to reveal its contents. This is an example of eventual honesty and not immediate as the example suggests.<br><br>
        We could 'fix' this problem of eventual honesty for the visual system by demanding that the destination folder be an open folder (probably too restrictive, given the limited screen size) or by having the destination folder temporarily open up to reveal that the file is now located within it. This last suggestion is also a bit tricky, for we might still want to determine that the file no longer resides in the original folder, so we would have to be sure that the new folder did not obstruct the view of the old folder. In practice, this might be too difficult to guarantee in general.

      "It has been suggested in this chapter that consistency could be considered a major category of interactive principles, on the same level as learnability, flexibility and robustness. If this had been the case, which principles discussed in this chapter would appear in support of consistency?",
    answer: `
        The discussion of consistency suggested that it can take many forms, because it is usually referred to in relation to some other feature of the interaction between user and system. Mentioned already in the text we have consistency related to the following principles:<br><br>
        - Familiarity - consistency with respect to prior real-world experience<br>
        - Generalizability - consistency with respect to experience with the same system or set of applications on the same platform<br><br>
        In addition, we could interpret some other principles as contributors to consistency:<br><br>
        - Affordance - consistency with understood intrinsic properties of an object, so a soft button on the screen should allow us to always 'push' on it to select some action<br>
        - Predictability - consistency of system response with user's expectation, given the user has some information about past interaction history<br>
        - Substitutivity - consistent permission from system to allow use of equivalent values for input and output<br>
        - Commensurate effort - consistency of effort with respect to doing and undoing tasks<br>
        - Response time stability - consistency of system response for similar actions<br><br>
        Some other principles for consistency from the text and elsewhere:<br><br>
        Consistency can be relative to the form of input/output expressions relative to the user's conceptual model of the system. An example in the text involves using keys whose relative positions are similar to commands for the systems (any set of four typewriter keys that form a diagonal to indicate up, down, left and right information for an input command).<br><br>
        As discussed in the exercise on colour, consistency can be with respect to social or cultural conventions (e.g., using red to indicate stop or hot, green for go, blue for cool).

    question:
      'Can you think of any instances in which the "noun-verb" guideline for operations, as suggested in the Apple human interface guidelines for the Desktop Interface, would be violated? Suggest other abstract guidelines or principles besides consistency which support your example. (Hint: Think about moving files around on the Desktop.)',
    answer: `
        The noun-verb guideline suggests that we can view all operations that the user will perform as being composed of an action (the verb) acting with one argument (the noun). In the case of moving a file (or copying, for that matter), the action (move or copy) requires more than one argument. The way the move operation is performed requires the user first to select the icon for the file to be moved and then to indicate the move operation implicitly by dragging the selected icon to the destination folder. The nouns in this dialogue are the file to be moved and the destination folder. The verb is the move operation. The natural way to express this is in the order noun-verb-noun. Strictly speaking, in order to stick with the noun-verb guideline, we would have to indicate both the target file and the destination folder before indicating the move operation. That would be consistent, relative to input expression, with most other commands on the desktop. However, some principles of direct manipulation and familiarity to the user are more important. Moving files by dragging them on the desktop is very similar to the way we can pick up any object in the physical world and move it to its new location. And the dragging operation is incremental and easily recoverable; moving to one place can be undone within the same operation since the dragging can continue until the file is released.<br><br>
        The file-moving example is a slightly contrived one, because some could argue that there is no violation of the noun-verb guideline (hence, moving is still consistent with respect to input expression) because the verb is 'move to destination folder'. Perhaps a better example is a command to search a file system for files matching some specification. Here, the action is to do the qualified search and the argument or noun is the set of folders or volumes of the system that you want searched. Typically, this kind of operation is defined by some dialog box that allows the user to indicate in any order the specifics of the operation (the search parameters) and the folders or volumes to search. Once this unordered dialog is complete, the user then indicates that it is OK for the system to perform the operation. This kind of form-filling dialog subscribes to neither the noun-verb or verb-noun guideline; the order is more flexible for the user than consistent.

    question:
      "Can you think of any instances in which the user control guideline suggested by Apple is not followed? (Hint: Think about the use of dialog boxes.)",
    answer: `
        The user control guideline states that, 'The user, not the computer, initiates and controls all actions.' In the case of dialog boxes, this guideline is clearly contradicted. A dialog box can be used to indicate when an error occurs in the system. Once this error has been detected and presented to the user in the dialog box, the only action that the system allows the user is to acknowledge the error and dismiss the dialog box. The system preempts the user dialog, with good reason. The preemptive nature of the dialog box is to ensure that the user actually notices that there was an error. Presumably, the only errors that will be produced in such an intrusive manner are ones which the user must know about before proceeding, so the preemption is warranted. But sometimes dialog boxes are not used to indicate errors and they still prevent the user from performing some actions that they might otherwise wish to perform. The dialog box might be asking the user to fill in some information to specify parameters for a command. If the user does not know what to provide, then they are stuck. A lot of the time, the user can find out the information by browsing through some other part of the system, but in order to do that they must exit the dialog box (and forfeit any of the settings that they might have already entered), find out the missing information and begin again. This kind of preemption is not desirable. It is probably this kind of preemption the user control guideline is intended to prevent, but it doesn't always get applied.

      "Find a book on guidelines. List the guidelines that are provided and classify them in terms of the activity in the software life cycle to which they would most likely apply.",
    answer: `
        We use as a source of guidelines Mayhew's book Principles and Guidelines in Software and User Interface Design [230]. In general, all guidelines offer constraints on the design activity and so should be known during the requirements phase. In the following list, we will concentrate on what other stages (architectural design, detailed design, coding and unit testing, integration and testing) will be most affected by the guidelines. The numbers in parentheses indicate the page reference for the given guideline.<br><br>
        Architectural design<br>
        - Present functionality through a familiar metaphor. (97)<br>
        - Provide similar execution style of analogous operations in different applications. (97)<br>
        - Organize the functionality of a system to support common user tasks. (442)<br>
        - Make invisible parts and processes visible to the user. (95)<br><br>
        Detailed design<br>
        - Consistent dialog style for different functions. (97)<br>
        - Match menu structure to task structure. (144)<br>
        - Create logical, distinctive and mutually exclusive semantic categories with clear meanings. (150)<br>
        - Design and organize a fill-in form to support the task. (184)<br>
        - Consider voice synthesis as an output device when the user's eyes are busy, when mobility is required, or when the user has no access to a workstation or screen. (427)<br><br>
        Coding and unit testing<br>
        - On full-screen text menus, present menu choice lists vertically. (148)<br>
        - In a fill-in form, use white space to create a balance and symmetry and lead the eye in the appropriate direction. (186)<br>
        - Avoid frequent use of shift or control keys. (256)<br>
        - Place high-use function keys within easy reach of the home row on the keyboard. (281)<br><br>
        Integration and testing<br>
        - Allow full command names and emphasize them in training, even if abbreviations are allowed. (261)

How would a programmer describe a pre-emptive dialog by purely graphical means? (Hint: Refer to the discussion in Section 8.5 concerning the shift from external and independent dialog management to presentation control of the dialog.)",
    answer:
      "Creating a pre-emptive dialog by graphical means is quite simple. In a graphics-based interaction, it is assumed that the user can only interact with parts of the system that are visible. In a windowing system, for example, the user can only direct input to a single, currently selected window, and the only means of changing the selected window would be by indicating with some gesture within that window. To create a pre-emptive dialog, the system can produce a window that covers the entire screen and make it the currently selected window. All user input would then be directed to that window and the user would have no means of selecting another window. The 'covering' window thus pre-empts any other user action except that which it is defined to support.",

      "Look ahead to the example of the state transition diagram for font characteristics presented in Chapter 16 (Section 16.3.3). Compare different interaction objects that could implement this kind of dialog. Use examples from existing toolkits (pull-down menus or dialog boxes) or create a novel interaction object.",
    answer:
      "In the example, we want to allow the user to toggle between three font characteristics - bold, italics and underline. Pull-down menus and dialog boxes are the most frequently used methods for implementing such a dialog. A pull-down menu would have the three choices listed with some way of indicating whether the characteristic was active or not. Upon each invocation of the menu, the user could change the active status of one font characteristic. For example, they could turn on the bold feature or turn off the underline feature. The important feature of this dialog is that more complex tasks (changing the active status of two or more font characteristics) can only be achieved by separate invocations of the menu. And often the only way the user can check the status would be by popping up the menu again (without invoking any action). This last point shows that the menu design alone does not support immediate display of relevant state changes as discussed in Chapter 7 under the synthesizability principle.<br><br>Within a dialog box, the user can effect several changes at one invocation. Technically, it is not the dialog box interaction device that allows for this, but the use of toggle buttons. Each font characteristic is represented by a box that acts as a simple on/off switch for that characteristic. As an aid to the user, the toggle button can change its appearance so that the user can know its status (on or off) by looking at it. A similar interaction widget is the checkbox, which would be labelled with the particular font characteristic. Clicking on the checkbox would put a mark in the box to indicate that the characteristic is on. Another click would remove the mark. In fact, a dialog box need not be used to portray the set of toggle buttons or checkboxes, as they could be presented continually so that the user can always view the current font characteristic settings. The reason a dialog box might be used is that there may be many font characteristics to choose from and the dialog box will keep them grouped together and preserve screen space by allowing them to be hidden and used on an as-needed basis.",

    answer:
      "Three possible ways of reducing interference are:<br><br>- During the initial training period, swap back and forth between learning the two sets of icons, with the aim of getting the subjects used to swapping between the two sets of remembered icons. However, this design could be argued to suffer the same flaws as the original. If the abstract icons had been taught in isolation perhaps they might have fared far better.<br>- We could invent a third set of 'random' icons (call them R). We could then interpose them in the experiment, that is present the icons in the orders RARN and RNRA. The intention is to swamp any transfer effect in the 'noise' of the random icons. It could be argued that our experiment then measures the robustness of the icon sets to such 'noise'!<br>- We could give the subjects multiple presentations, for example ANAN and NANA presentation orders. This would not remove transfer effects, but it would give us some way to quantify them. Imagine that in the ANAN group the second presentation of the abstract icons was significantly worse than the first, but there was not a similar effect for natural icons in the NANA group. This would give us both positive evidence of a transfer effect, and perhaps some quantitative measure. However, even going from this additional evidence to a strong conclusion will be difficult.<br><br>Notice that all the above measures require additional subject time and one has to constantly weigh up the advantages of richer experiments against those of larger subject groups.",

However, this level of interpretation, and generalization, can be helpful nonetheless (for example, a record of what the user has already done successfully or how often he has used the application).

Try listening to social chat over cups of tea - collect examples of different forms of contextual utterance.",
    answer:
      "There are often objects of shared attention during social chat, perhaps a notice board, or magazines on a coffee table. These will be one obvious source of context. When students record statements such as 'I like that', they should also record whether the indexical refers to a previous utterance or to something external. They should try to observe exactly how external references are made: for example, whether people point to a notice, refer implicitly to the article someone else is reading or use the direction of their own gaze.<br><br>In a small group, students should listen particularly carefully for the use of the pronoun 'you'. Does it refer to the whole group (excluding the speaker), or to a particular person? If the latter, then how is it made explicit - eye gaze, body position? Other pronouns like 'we' or 'she' can be equally contextual.<br><br>Students should also look out for implicit context, for example 'a longer tail would improve the aerodynamics', spoken when the listener is looking at a picture of a kite. Although the sentence has no pronoun there is an implicit subject 'of the kite you're looking at'. This form of contextual statement can become arbitrarily obscure, for example as one person meets another: 'it's in your pigeon hole' - referring to an overdue report. As students become more adept they can listen more carefully, looking for the shift in conversational focus, and breakdowns where the context is not successfully negotiated.",

Whilst collecting data and when ordering your notes, look for breakdowns and misunderstandings, and for implicit communication through objects. Look also at a particular task over a period of time, and note the number of interruptions as a worker performs the task, or the way a single task is contributed to by several workers.",
    answer:
      "This exercise is similar to Exercise 15.5. However, whereas the task analysis in 15.5 is quite structured, this exercise is not intended to produce the same form of precise task sequences, etc. The intention is to expose students to the vast range of social situations within a typical work environment. Recording techniques such as those described in Chapter 9 might well be used.<br><br>In particular, this exercise is a good chance to introduce the use of video or audio recording equipment if it is available. Students will soon learn how difficult it is to position a microphone so that it picks up more than one worker and so that recordings are not dominated by the sound of a typist. Similarly, they can gain first-hand experience of the problems of static camera positioning. If you are lucky, you may have access to multiple cameras and split-screen recording equipment.<br><br>Although such equipment can be useful, its lack is not a disaster.

    question:
      "The following is a list of objects found in one of the authors' kitchens:<br>teapot, mug, soup bowl, plate, spoon, table knife, cook's knife, fork, saucepan, frying pan, kettle, casserole, fish slice, tin opener, baking tray, scales, mixing bowl, glasses, jugs, corkscrew, rolling pin, ladle, egg cup, chopping board.<br>Produce a taxonomy using the TDH notation of these objects. Does it obey the TAKD uniqueness rule? Compare your answer with someone else's. (Note: the authors had great difficulty with items like the corkscrew, which did not fit easily into any generic category - perhaps you did better.)",
    answer:
      "As the authors had already produced a partial taxonomy, we interviewed two domain experts (cooks). They were asked to describe how they would group and classify the kitchen items. They were explicitly told (and reminded) that they could have multiple classifications and put the same item into several categories. The authors then cast their answers into TDH notation.<br><br>One of the subjects was a doctor and used to medical taxonomies of disease. Despite stressing the looseness of the classifications, he insisted on a complete taxonomic tree (Figure Ex15.1.1).<br><br>As you see all his branches are XOR branches. On discovering that 'jug' had to fit in two places in his taxonomy, he split it into 'serving jug' and 'measuring jug'. This emphasises the need for the task analyst rather than the domain expert to actually draw up the taxonomy!<br><br>As it is a true tree it clearly does not satisfy the uniqueness rule, but the only way it could is to invent spurious new categories. One could under 'opening' add categories for 'bottles' (containing corkscrew) and tins (containing tin opener), but this would not improve clarity.<br><br>If the first subject was a stickler for precision, the second subject preferred broad categories. Figure Ex15.1.2 shows her initial classification.<br><br>We wanted to put some additional structure on this and so, after some discussion, the subject agreed that her basic distinctions were those of function ('making meals' etc.) and between cutlery and non-cutlery. Using these to form an AND branch, we obtained Figure Ex15.1.3.<br><br>This taxonomy does not obey the uniqueness rule either; for example, fish slice and ladle always appear together. In terms of KRG they are both:<br><br>kitchen object/material(cutlery)/<br>function{cooking meals,serving meals}/<br>The TAKD purist might demand extra categories to fulfil the uniqueness rule. However, the authors would recommend that students simply be taught to recognise the rule and use it as a heuristic.<br><br>It is interesting that both domain experts focused on the functional view of the items, just as the authors did in the book. This suggests that it is indeed a generic way of classifying kitchen objects and would thus be a good candidate for classification in a catalogue or menu system. The second subject also noted that her original breakdown was inspired, not so much by the function per se, but by where the items were stored in her kitchen - itself determined largely by function. This is perhaps the physical equivalent of a menu system!",

    question:
      "Complete the tea-making manual in Figure 15.7. Do you think it would be useful? Think of situations where such a manual would be helpful and where a more conceptual manual would be better.",
    answer:
      "Although a manual for tea making might be regarded as a little extreme, such manuals are useful in several situations. You could pose this exercise, together with the initial task analysis, for different domains where more of the following situations are pertinent.<br><br>The first situation where a procedural manual is useful is for the absolute novice who has no idea of the conceptual background. This might be a first-time user, or when an activity is performed very infrequently. A good example of the latter is the installation of computer equipment, which most users perform only once every couple of years. Similarly, recipe books are laid out in a highly procedural fashion, although unfortunately not always clearly:<br><br>Beat the egg whites until they froth,<br>then put them into a ramekin.<br>While beating the egg whites, slowly add the white wine.<br><br>The second situation where a procedural manual is useful is where there is some sort of safety-critical aspect, and erroneous decisions, even those carefully considered, can be disastrous. Often, in such a situation, the additional stress can cloud judgement and make it far safer to stick to a predetermined drill. Emergency procedures in large chemical or nuclear installations are an example of this -- when an emergency arises the operators are expected to stick closely to the set procedures. The accident at Chernobyl came about in part because the operators felt that they knew enough to override the rule book. Reading a manual in such circumstances may be too time consuming, but an HTA can be used to train the operator to respond automatically. The use of HTA for military training is largely in this vein.<br><br>Thirdly, the situation may not be safety critical, but it may be time critical. Much analysis may have gone into discovering the most efficient way to perform a task, and that way is then taught, by rote, to the operators. Although this form of time and motion approach is less likely to be useful in an information intensive job than in a factory (if there!), there are jobs, such as telephony, where it is still important.<br><br>Finally, the user may not have sufficient knowledge to understand why a process works, but can follow a set of instructions. This may relate either to the complexity of the task or to the skill of the operator. If one were teaching kitchen craft to mentally handicapped people, then just such a procedural description of tea making would be required.<br><br>The problem with such procedural manuals is that they give the operator no real feeling as to why the tasks are performed in the way they are. Whether such a manual is preferred by a novice user depends very much on the user's personality. Some people prefer to have a set of instructions to get them started, whereas others find it very difficult to use something without some sort of conceptual understanding.<br><br>The procedural manual really comes unstuck when the set of tasks considered is not complete. When faced with a radically new task the user must understand enough of the domain to perform it ad hoc or to modify an existing procedure. One frequent cause of entirely new situations is unforeseen breakdowns of equipment. For example, if the kettle was broken, one could then abstract that the real reason for boiling the kettle was to heat water and that this could be performed by heating a bowl of water in the microwave oven. Such a modification of the procedure is not even suggested by the procedural manual.",

    answer:
      "The easiest starting point is simply to go around the office noting down what is there:<br>typewriter, corrector fluid, desk diary, pen, pencil, scissors, envelopes, paper clips, typing paper, post-it notes, telephone, telephone directory (internal and external), filing cabinet containing folders, clock, wall calendar.<br>This list can then be used to begin to build either a knowledge-based or an entity--relation description. However, the latter will also require at least a list of actors. In a university office this might include the following:<br>secretary, lecturer, student (undergraduate), research student, research staff, administrator<br>However, the roles that they take may not be simple. For example, we may find that a lecturer comes into the office to use the typewriter. That is the lecturer acts in the role of typist.<br>Neither of these descriptions can be complete, nor can an HTA begin, without a list of activities. This can be obtained in two main ways. First, students can simply make an unstructured list of all the activities they see, and then add structure to it. Alternatively, they can follow specific tasks noting what is done in what order. In the latter case, they are encouraged to write the list of activities in a purely sequential manner -- they are observing. Only later will they build upon this a hierarchical interpretation.<br>It might obviously cause severe inconvenience if all the members of a class were to interview the office staff. However, to gain first hand interview experience, some domain expert can be invited into a class or lecture to talk about their work and be questioned about it. Alternatively, students could make their own notes from a preprepared videotaped interview.<br>If a question of this sort is used as an assessment, then we would suggest that students hand in not just the completed task analysis, but intermediate notes and representations. The most important thing in determining the effectiveness of their analysis is the care with which they carried out the original observation and subsequent working.",

In the graphics submenu, the option selection and the action selections are each packaged up into a named subdialog (draw-line and draw-circle). However, in the text submenu the top-level description of each option is included within the definition of text-submenu. With all notations, there is a similarly wide degree of stylistic choice. Suitably named subdialogs can make the entire dialog far easier to read, but, on the other hand, too many levels of abstraction can be confusing.<br><br>Also notice that the BNF description does not distinguish between selecting a menu option or choosing a point on the drawing surface. Both are described as position-mouse followed by CLICK-MOUSE. At the level of user movements and keystrokes, this is perfectly accurate, but loses the clearly perceived difference. This might be a good time to look at the UAN notation [165], which does distinguish these<br><br>Production rules<br><br>As the drawing tool is largely sequential, we would expect to find the production rule description rather cumbersome. The main problem is keeping track of how deep you are in the stack of menus, submenus and options. Watch out for solutions where the higher-level options are still active, when the lower-level dialogs are operating. For example, the top-level description might read:<br><br>Sel-graphics    -->    <pop-up graphics menu><br>Sel-text        -->    <pop-up text menu><br>Sel-paint       -->    <pop-up paint menu><br><br>This could exhibit strange behaviour. Imagine that the user is in the middle of drawing a line (using the first description in Section 12.3.1). Then after selecting the first point (at which point the system event 'rest-line' is active), the user goes back to the top-level menu and selects 'text'. At this point the text pop-up menu appears, and the user is able to start putting text annotations on the drawing area:<br><br>Sel-left-just          -->  left-start<br>C-point left-start     -->  left-type <typing cursor on><br>Type-line left-type    -->  <put text left justified> <typing cursor off><br><br>The user selects left justified and goes to the drawing surface and clicks at a point. However, at this point there are two rules that can fire.<br><br>C-point left-start - from the text rules (above), setting the location for typing.<br>C-point rest-line - from the drawing rules in Section 16.4.2, putting another point on the line.<br>Whereas it is certainly the first of these that the user expects, the second is possible because the 'rest-line}' event is still active. Also looking back to the definitions in Section 16.4.2, we see that rubber banding would still be on during the entire text menu selection process.<br><br>There are various fixes for this. One way is to use 'clean up' rules as used in CCT in Section 12.2.2. For example, we would modify the top-level description so that it is not always active:<br><br>Sel-graphics main-active<br>               -->  graphics-active <pop-up graphics menu><br>Sel-text main-active<br>               -->  text-active <pop-up text menu><br>Sel-paint main-active<br>               -->  paint-active <pop-up paint menu><br><br>The submenu options are then altered to update these activity events (the semantic actions have been omitted for clarity):<br><br>Sel-line graphics-active     --> start-line<br>C-point start-line           --> rest-line<br>C-point rest-line            --> rest-line<br>D-point rest-line            --> main-active<br><br>This now ensures that the user finished low-level dialogs before selecting new options at the top level.",

      "Develop the JSD diagram in Figure 16.14, expanding the various nodes until you get to basic operations such as 'prompt \"login\"' or 'user types in password'. Expand the 'delete employee' node using the dialog style as described in Figure 16.13, and use your imagination for the rest.",
    answer:
      "This is a fairly simple exercise, and some of the nodes are expanded here. In Figure Ex16.3.1, the login subdialog is expanded, but it assumes that the user types the correct password during the login process. To change it to accommodate incorrect passwords would be inordinately complex for two reasons. Firstly, the JSD diagram does not distinguish between user choice (whether to add or delete a record) and system choice.<br><br>JSD diagram for logging in to personnel system<br><br>Ex16.3.1 - JSD diagram for logging in to personnel system<br><br>This is evident in both the change and delete subdialogs (Figures Ex16.3.2 and Ex16.3.3).<br><br>JSD diagram for updating a record.<br><br>Ex16.3.2 - JSD diagram for updating a record<br><br>JSD diagram for record deletion subdialog<br><br>Ex16.3.3 - JSD diagram for record deletion subdialog<br><br>In each of these the actual updating of the file is put in an 'optional' box as the user may have answered 'N' (no) when asked to confirm the update. Secondly, making the dialog dependent on the password would mean that the rest of the dialog would sit under an 'option' box with another box to abort. This was acceptable in the delete and change subdialogs, but if this were applied to the login sequence, the resulting dialog would become degenerate and hide the normal hierarchical structure. This problem of whether or not to include exceptional cases and error behaviour is extremely complex. In the early stages of design it is the normal cases that one wants to consider. Later on one might refine the dialog descriptions, or alternatively annotate the normal description.",

      "In the example of the digital watch in Section 16.3.8 (Design Focus), what would be the dangerous states? Relate the lexical issues of the buttons for a digital watch to these dangerous states and provide some design advice. Does your own digital watch satisfy these criteria?",
    answer:
      "The time and alarm setting modes are dangerous states, in that we do not want to change either accidentally. Design advice would be to include some sort of guard that makes it difficult to get accidentally into the time-setting modes, or, alternatively, once within the modes, to make the buttons that advance the time difficult to press.<br><br>The watch in the Design Focus guards these states by requiring button 'A' to be pressed for two seconds before the mode changes. It might be easy to press a watch button accidentally, but it is quite hard to hold it down. This solution would not of course work for a keyboard, where it is quite easy to hold a key down accidentally. Other watches guard these modes by insetting the mode change button or the buttons required to actually change the time. One has to press these buttons with a sharp instrument, such as a pencil - not an easy slip to make. Some digital clocks guard the mode by making you hold a button down continuously while you are changing the time. Guarding the mode is far preferable to guarding the change buttons, as the latter makes it very hard to change the time when you want to do it.<br><br>In fact, changing the time is often a problem for the reversibility of watch and clock dialogs. Typically there is a button to advance the time by one hour or one minute, but not one to put the time back. So, if you press the minute advance button once too often, you have to press it 59 more times to reverse the mistake!",

    question:
      "Using the model-oriented approach with the example graphics program described in Section 17.2.3, specify the move operation as a schema which acts on the currently selected objects. Is the operation you have defined cumulative (two successive moves can be done as one move which is the sum of the other two) or is it 'forgetful?' Discuss the implications of the framing problem in your definition.",
    answer:
      "Students may not have a great familiarity with the Z notation used in this textbook, especially if they do not have a computer science background which emphasizes formal specification. Nevertheless, we will provide a model answer to this exercise in the Z notation and leave it to the instructor to decide whether an alternative language can be used to express the same ideas.\n\nTo accommodate the specification of the move operation, we will first need a function which allows us to add two coordinate points together. We just provide the declaration of this function here.\n\n| _ + _: Point multiplied by Point maps to Point\n\nThe motivation for this function is so that we can define a move operation with a single argument, called delta? below, which will specify how far to move the centres of every selected shape. This approach, using relative movements, will allow for two consecutive moves to be defined with the overall movement being the sum of the individual moves. Another approach (which would be quite cumbersome to define for a set of selected objects) would be to specify the move operation as an absolute operation, the argument(s) to the move explicitly indicating the new value for the centre(s) of each selected shape. This operation definition would not be cumulative.\n\nInitially, we might want to define the move operation simply to update the centre position of all selected shapes.\n\n___Move___________________________________________________________\n| State\n| State'\n| delta? : Point\n|____________________\n| forall id : selected dot shapes'(id).centre = shapes(id).centre + delta?\n|________________________________________________________________________\nThere are a number of details in this defined operation which are left (dangerously) open to interpretation. Many of these are framing conditions on the Move operation. For example, what happens to shapes which are not selected? The normal intuition on this operation would be that they stay put, but the above definition actually allows them to change in any way - including the possibility of disappearing altogether. To ensure that unselected objects stay the same as they were before the operation, we would have to add a predicate to the definition.\n\n___Move___________________________________________________________\n| State\n| State'\n| delta? : Point\n|____________________\n| forall id : selected dot shapes'(id).centre = shapes(id).centre + delta?\n| forall id : (dom shapes - selected) dot shapes'(id) = shapes(id)\n|________________________________________________________________________\nWe also need to explicitly state that no new shapes are introduced into the system, i.e., that the domain of shapes remains the same.\n\n___Move___________________________________________________________\n| State\n| State'\n| delta? : Point\n|____________________\n| forall id : selected dot shapes'(id).centre = shapes(id).centre + delta?\n| forall id : (dom shapes - selected) dot shapes'(id) = shapes(id).centre\n| dom shapes' = dom shapes\n|________________________________________________________________________\nFor those familiar with Z, it is possible to collapse the last three predicates in the above schema to one predicate using functional overriding from the basic Z mathematical toolkit (see Spivey [328]).\n\nAnother framing issue which has impact on the interactive style of this graphics system is specifying what happens to the selected set of shapes after the move operation. Our current definition says nothing about this. Two clear options are whether the set of selected shapes remains the same or becomes the empty set (no selected objects). For reasons of compositionality (for defining consecutive move operations or consecutive operations targeted at the same set of shapes) we choose the former option, and specify this below.\n\n___Move___________________________________________________________\n| State\n| State'\n| delta? : Point\n|____________________\n| forall id : selected dot shapes'(id).centre = shapes(id).centre + delta?\n| forall id : (dom shapes - selected) dot shapes'(id) = shapes(id)\n| dom shapes' = dom shapes\n| selected' = selected\n|________________________________________________________________________\n[Note: Experienced Z users would probably choose the functional overriding operator (override) to more concisely express the first three predicates above.]",

    question:
      "Write a similar schema for RESIZE. It should have the following informal semantics. The width and height attributes are of the shape's bounding box. The resize operation should make one corner of the bounding box be at the current mouse position (supplied as the argument current_pos?).",
    answer:
      "Strictly speaking, there are some errors in the Z usage for the hint in this exercise. The type Point is not a schema type, and so it is not meaningful to use schema selection, as in expressions like centre.x and corner.x. The alert Z student should pick up on this error. However, the spirit of the hint is still valid. To make things legal in Z, we can change the declaration of Point as follows:\n\n___Point____________________________________________________________\n| x,y : R\n|__________________________________________________________________________\n\nTo best specify this resizing operation, we will require to explicitly model the bounding box of a shape. We introduce a type, called BoundingBox which will represent the corners of the surrounding box which defines the extent of a shape. In fact, in Figure 17.1, we have drawn the bounding box for the circle but we have not made that information explicit in the specification in the text of this chapter. We omit details in this sample answer on 'rectangular' constraints for the corners of the bounding box (e.g., that upper left and right corners have the same y-coordinate values but the x-coordinate of the upper left corner is strictly less than the x-coordinate of the upper right corner, etc.)\n\n___BoundingBox______________________________________________________\n| upperleft, upperright,\n| lowerleft, lowerright : Point\n|___________________________________________\n| upperleft.x less than or equal to upperright.x\n| upperleft.y = upperright.y\n|\n| ...\n|__________________________________________________________________________\n\nWe can add the bounding box as information known about shapes, by extending the definition of Shape. A constraint on the bounding box, motivated by the hint to this exercise, is that its width and height are the same as the width and height of the shape. In addition, the centre coordinates are related to the width and height. Note below that we use the names height and width in the definition of Shape to increase its readability.\n\n___Shape______________________________________________________\n| type : Shape_type\n| width : R\n| height : R\n| centre : Point\n| bb : BoundingBox\n|___________________________________________\n| width = 2 multiplied by (centre.x - bb.upperleft.x)\n| height = 2 multiplied by (centre.y - bb.upperleft.y)\n| width = (bb.upperleft.x - bb.upperright.x)\n| height = (bb.upperleft.y - bb.lowerleft.y)\n|__________________________________________________________________________\n\nResizing can be viewed as changing the size of the bounding box. At a relatively abstract level, we can simply specify the resizing operation with a single argument indicating the new bounding box for the selected shape. A precondition for the operation is that there is only one selected shape.\n\n___Resize______________________________________________________\n| State\n| State'\n| newbb? : BoundingBox\n|___________________________________________\n| #selected = 1\n| forall id : selected dot shapes'(id).bb = newbb?\n| forall id : (dom shapes - selected) dot shapes'(id) = shapes(id)\n| dom shapes' = dom shapes\n| selected' = selected\n|__________________________________________________________________________",

      "Imagine a normal calculator except that it displays A for 0, B for 1, up to J for 9. So the number 372 would appear as DHC. Does this affect the formal transparency of the calculator? Should it?",
    answer:
      "Formally, this would not affect the transparency property of a calculator. Any function from display to effect that held for the numbers would also hold for their alphabetic counterparts by just composing it with the code A for 0, B for 1, up to J for 9. Of course, most people would probably find the encoded calculator quite a bit more difficult to use than one that used the normal ten digits. The important lesson here is that the formal expression of the transparency property does not indicate how difficult it is for a human to determine the function between display and effect. The formal expression just requires that there be some function. In practice, human users would probably judge the encoded calculator as unpredictable (that is, not transparent). The moral is that even though we can capture a usability property formally this does not mean that we have captured the entire intent of the property. The transparency property would have to be augmented in order to measure the complexity, from the user's perspective, of the function between display and effect.",

    answer:
      "The 'back' button on a browser and the 'undo' function in applications are conceptually similar but operate at different levels of abstraction and with different scopes:\n\n1. **Scope**: \n   - **Back Button**: Typically operates at the level of navigation history within the browser, moving sequentially through visited pages or states. It does not necessarily reverse specific user actions but rather navigates through the browsing history.\n   - **Undo Function**: Operates at the level of specific user actions within an application. It reverses the effects of the last user action, such as text input, drawing, or other changes.\n\n2. **Granularity**: \n   - **Back Button**: Jumps between entire states or pages, affecting the entire application context and potentially the entire browser session.\n   - **Undo Function**: Reverses specific actions or commands, often affecting only the immediate state or document being edited.\n\n3. **Interaction with Data**: \n   - **Back Button**: In web applications, the 'back' button does not directly manipulate data but navigates through the presentation of data (e.g., forms, pages).\n   - **Undo Function**: Directly affects data or application state by reversing the effects of data manipulation actions.\n\nIn summary, while both 'undo' and the 'back' button involve reversing actions, they serve different purposes and operate at different levels of granularity and scope.",

      "This exercise involves detailed empirical observation and analysis of how different systems handle navigation using the 'back' button. The behavior can vary significantly:\n\n1. **Single Page Applications (SPA)**: In modern web applications (SPAs), the 'back' button may not always navigate back sequentially through a linear history of pages. Instead, it might manipulate the application state or navigate through components within a single page.\n\n2. **Browser History Management**: Different browsers may implement navigation history differently, affecting how 'back' and 'forward' buttons operate.\n\n3. **Form Submissions and Data Persistence**: Systems handling form submissions and data persistence might cache or re-fetch data when navigating using 'back', affecting user experience and perceived responsiveness.\n\n4. **Multiple Windows/Frames**: Behavior in systems with multiple windows or frames can be complex, with 'back' potentially affecting navigation within frames or across multiple windows.\n\nBuilding a model involves documenting these observations systematically, noting behaviors like session persistence, data reloading, and navigation flow control.

As the phrase in question is on both displays there is no problem about where to display the hand: it is placed over the words 'Thinking about' on your display. (Note that the group pointer is at a different physical location on each display).<br><br>Arguably the group pointer is even more important when there are separate views than when the view is shared. With a shared view the participants can be assured that they are seeing the same thing and so can assume a shared context. With separate views the participants are likely to have various problems when they forget that the others' views are different. For example, they will have trouble with indexical expressions or with relative statements 'the thing at the top'. The presence of a group pointer can help the participants to gain a shared focus.<br><br>On the other hand, the very presence of the group pointer can encourage the participants in a false sense of shared context. One could therefore argue that when participants want to enter a period of shared focus and synchronous discussion, they also move to a shared view. However, for the rest of this answer we'll assume that the views stay different.<br><br>What do we do when the group pointer is outside of the view? For example, in Figure 19.8, your colleague might move the group pointer to the line starting 'More adaptable'. In this case, your screen cannot display the group pointer in its correct position. Various options suggest themselves.<br><br>One could have the hand icon appear at the very top of your display with the finger pointing straight upward, meaning 'see above'. Similarly, if the group pointer were below the screen the icon could appear at the bottom pointing down. If such icons were displayed then the user could scroll the screen upwards until the group focus was found. Alternatively, one could arrange that to click on the icon scrolled one to the correct position.<br><br>Instead of, or in addition to, these 'out of view' icons, one could use the scrollbar and display the group pointer's position in it, thus allowing the user to see where it is easily, and scroll there if appropriate.<br><br>In the hypertext case, the solutions depend very much on the particular style of the system. If the individual nodes are large, then even if two participants are acting on the same node they may have different views, in which case all the above measures become relevant. If the participants are looking at different nodes, then the first action of a group pointer should be to direct attention to the node of interest. In a hypertext where the node graph is shown, this can be achieved by displaying the group pointer on the node of interest. Alternatively, if the graph is not displayed, the presence of a group pointer could be shown by adding a 'go to the focus node' button, rather like the 'home' button in many HyperCard stacks.<br><br>Although it is not mentioned in the question, it is worth also considering the display of other people's insertion points. In Figure 19.8, although your insertion point is within your colleague's view, it is not displayed in any way. There is no reason why other people's insertion points should not be displayed (suitably identified) when they fall within your view and vice versa. In addition, one might want some indicator on your scrollbar to show where your colleague's current view is. Such indicators can enhance group awareness and be a focus for initiating direct communication.",

      "Repeat the exercise in Section 19.6.1, but this time look for shared data on your system. Is the data updated by one person and viewed by many, or have you files or databases which are updated by several people? If the latter, find out what methods are used to prevent two users changing the same data at the same time. There may be no mechanism at all, a computerized one (for example, locking) or a social protocol (for example, a floppy disk is passed around).",

    answer:
      "The leisure market is important to the computer industry and, being commercially lucrative, can provide an impetus for development which can then be exploited in other spheres.<br><br>If virtual reality takes off in games it will result in the development of cheaper equipment and more robust techniques, since the games customer tends to be young (and not overly rich) but with sophisticated expectations. Indeed, many research projects in universities are currently using equipment developed specifically for games, since the more powerful, general purpose equipment is prohibitively expensive.<br><br>Another possible advantage is that it makes the technology familiar and therefore accessible and acceptable.<br><br>A possible disadvantage is that the use of this technology in games may trivialize it so that it is not considered as a serious solution to other more weighty problems. However, this seems less likely than the advantages outlined above.",

    answer:
      "This exercise could be expanded to allow students to carry out a brief literature review on the applications of virtual reality techniques. In general they are most promising in areas that cannot be explored in reality, either because it is physically impossible (such as in the manipulation of molecules discussed in Section 20.3.2) or physically dangerous, as in space. Models can be physically manipulated and interacted with using virtual reality methods rather than simply observed. Chemical and medical research, meteorology, oceanography, seismology are all areas that could benefit from such techniques.",

      "What factors are likely to delay the widespread use of video in interfaces? What applications could benefit most from its use?",
    answer:
      "Some of the factors are the costs in terms of hardware and software for compression and decompression; the slow speed due to the high bandwidth; the overall cost of equipment (for example, camera, video, CD); the lack of design tools to exploit video; the lack of specialist skills amongst designers. Many applications have been suggested as candidates for the integration of video. Educational systems, games and help systems are liable to benefit since information can be passed more clearly and memorably and new dimensions added. Other areas such as virtual reality can use video together with graphics in the creation of their artificial worlds. CSCW systems can use video to provide a face-to-face communication link between distributed workers (see Chapters 14 and 19). However, although these appear to be areas where video has a promising future, its use needs to be carefully considered and its consequences investigated. It may be that it will not fulfil its initial promise.",
